## Instructions
Follow the instructions in [LeanInduction.lean](LeanInduction.lean) to complete definitions and proofs that are currently completed using `sorry`.

```

## Submitting
To submit the assignment, simply push your changes to your assignment repository. You may push changes as often as you like. We will grade the latest change at the assignment due date. 


## Research
During this quarter we will collect fine-grained information of edits you make to the `.lean` files in your assignments. We will use this information in the development of tools for the Lean theorem prover. You can find out more by looking at the [information sheet](InformationSheet.pdf) in this repo. This data will be kept private, besides its use by Kyle Thompson (one of the course TAs), Sorin Lerner, and their immediate collaborators. If at any point you would like to be removed from the study, please notify Kyle Thompson (r7thompson@ucsd.edu).
